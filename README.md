# MIPS 32 CORE WITH HAZARD DETECTION & DATA FORWARDING 
 The MIPS 32 CPU core is a five stage pipelined central processing unit based on the MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) architecture with Hazard detection and data forwarding unit.MIPS is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture that is widely used in embedded systems, networking devices, and other applications.
 
The term "MIPS 32" refers to a specific version of the MIPS architecture, which is a 32-bit instruction set architecture. It means that the CPU core can process instructions that are 32 bits in length. The MIPS 32 architecture provides a standardized set of instructions and registers that the CPU core can execute.

Some key features of a MIPS 32 CPU core include:

**RISC architecture:** MIPS 32 follows the RISC philosophy, which emphasizes simplicity and efficiency by using a reduced set of instructions that can be executed in a single clock cycle.

**Instruction pipeline:** MIPS 32 CPUs typically use a classic five-stage pipeline, which allows for efficient instruction fetching, decoding, execution, memory access, and write-back stages.

**Register set:** MIPS 32 CPUs have a set of 32 general-purpose registers (GPRs) that can be used for arithmetic, data manipulation, and storage operations

**The MIPS32 instruction set architecture (ISA) **is a 32-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture developed by MIPS Technologies. 

Instruction Formats: MIPS32 instructions are encoded in a fixed-length format of 32 bits. The three primary instruction formats are:
a. R-Format: Used for arithmetic and logical operations between registers.
b. I-Format: Used for immediate arithmetic and logical operations, memory loads, and branches.
c. J-Format: Used for unconditional and jump instructions.
